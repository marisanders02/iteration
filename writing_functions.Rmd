## Writing Functions 

Finding z-scores.

```{r}
x_vec <- rnorm(n = 25, mean = 10, sd = 3.5)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec))/sd(x_vec)
```


Write a function to find z-score.

```{r}
z_scores <- function(x) {
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("x needs to be numeric")
  } 
  
  if (length(x) < 5) {
    stop("you need at least 5 numbers to compute the z-score")
  }
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}

z_scores(x = x_vec)
```


Does this always work?

- No, it doesn't work for single numbers or character vectors, can add checks to return an informative error.

```{r, error = TRUE}
z_scores(x = 3)
z_scores(x = c("my", "name", "is"))
```
